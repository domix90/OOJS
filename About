Everything in JavaScript is an object or can be treated like one. 


DOM elements are objects and have properties and methods.

1. For example, I can get an element styles with the style property.
I can get the HTML that an element is made of with the innerHTML property.
I can even get an element's parent with the parentNode property, or
its children with the childNodes property.
DOM objects have methods as well, like getElementById or appendChild.

2. Arrays have properties like length and methods like push, pop, and concat.
