Everything in JavaScript is an object or can be treated like one. 


DOM elements are objects and have properties and methods.

1. For example, I can get an element styles with the style property.
I can get the HTML that an element is made of with the innerHTML property.
I can even get an element's parent with the parentNode property, or
its children with the childNodes property.
DOM objects have methods as well, like getElementById or appendChild.

2. Arrays have properties like length and methods like push, pop, and concat.

3. Properties are like object specific variables that store information
in a series of key value pairs.


4. Methods are object specific functions that let your object do something or
let something be done to it.

5. Object literals are one way to create an object and
they're really great when you're modeling only one single specific thing.

EXAMPLE 

const ernie {
  name : 'Ernie', 
  animal : 'dog', 
  breed : 'pug',
  bark : function () {
          console.log('Woof');
  }
}

6. What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is putting all of the properties and methods into a package and
attaching it to a variable through an object.
